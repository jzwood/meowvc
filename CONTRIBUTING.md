# So you want to contribute to mµ?

That’s great! Make a pull request and I’ll review it.

**Possible Features**
- add Ora/log-update to pretty cli interaction
- add automerge messages (ie don't fix silently)(?)
- compress (gzip/shoco?) everything that can be compressed
- add tab autocomplete (?)

**Guidelines**:

1. Make sure all changes conform to ESLint.
1. All io must be async
1. The heart of mµ is <u>simplicity</u>, let’s keep it that way.

That’s all I got. If I think of something important to add I will.
